# PRODIGY_DS_01
✅ Task 1 – Visualizing Population Distribution Using Bar Charts and Histograms

📊 Description:

Create visualizations such as bar charts and stacked bar plots to explore and present the distribution of categorical or continuous variables. In this task, we focus on analyzing global population data using Python, including the distribution by total population, as well as by gender (male and female). We visualize both the top and bottom 10 countries for various metrics, comparing data for different years (2022 and 2016).

This task helps in identifying trends, outliers, and insights about population demographics using bar plots and provides clarity on how population varies across countries and over time.

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas – For data handling and cleaning

NumPy – For numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For plotting and visualizations

🚀 Key Features Implemented:

Read and clean population data from a CSV file

Remove unnecessary columns and handle missing/duplicate data

Extract top and bottom 10 countries based on total population

Create bar plots for:

Total population in 2022 and 2016

Top 10 male and female populations in 2022

Create stacked bar plots to show gender-wise population for top and bottom 10 countries

Compare trends across years and demographics

📌 Visual Outputs:

Horizontal bar plots for Top 10 and Bottom 10 countries (2022, 2016)

Gender-wise bar plots for Top 10 male and female populations

Stacked bar charts to compare male and female populations together in a single visualization

📁 Dataset Used:

worldpopulationdata.csv – Contains population data for multiple countries, years, and gender-based categories identified by Series Codes.
